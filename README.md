# My Destination API

Backend Java Spring service that provides an API for doing CRUD operations on destinations (e.g. adding and getting destinations).

This is a demo app to help me learn Java Spring and to do calls on from the frontend My Destinations app.

## How to run

`java -jar build/libs/my-destinations-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
